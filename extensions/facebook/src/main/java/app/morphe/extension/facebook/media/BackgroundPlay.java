/**
 * Keep playing in the background: a video you started keeps its sound after you leave Facebook.
 *
 * <p>Facebook already has the whole feature, behind server flags this account doesn't get. Its
 * BackgroundPlaybackManager listens for activity stops, and once no Facebook window is left it
 * reads the last play or pause any FbGrootPlayer recorded and asks its handlers whether to carry
 * that video on. Its fullscreen handler builds a separate "background_playback" player from the
 * paused one, seeks it to where you were, plays it with BY_BACKGROUND_PLAY and starts
 * PlaybackNotificationService, whose notification and media session play, pause and skip, and whose
 * dismissal or a swipe of Facebook out of recents releases that player. Coming back, the handler
 * pauses and releases it and hides the notification. Audio focus loss and calls pause it the way
 * Facebook set its player up.
 *
 * <p>The patch keeps all of that and changes who qualifies:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Once a video you started plays, the extension makes a manager of its own and gives it one
 *       fullscreen handler ({@link #ensureManager}), since Facebook only makes them for a fullscreen
 *       player when its flags are on.</li>
 *   <li>A video counts as yours when its start came within {@link #TAP_WINDOW_MS} of a tap and wasn't
 *       one Facebook sends because something came into view ({@link #started}), the rule Tap to play
 *       uses. It stops counting when Facebook starts it again on its own after a pause.</li>
 *   <li>When that handler is asked ({@link #deciding}), it goes on only for the video whose pause
 *       Facebook just recorded, when that pause found it playing, came no more than
 *       {@link #LEAVE_WINDOW_MS} before Facebook asked, and didn't follow a tap within
 *       {@link #TAPPED_PAUSE_MS} (your own pause), and the screen that stopped wasn't closing or being
 *       rebuilt. Its checks of the server flag, the sound setting, eligible content, the trigger and
 *       the fullscreen player type answer yes then ({@link #skipCheck}), and a missing title gets a
 *       plain one ({@link #title}). Every other video gets a no at once.</li>
 *   <li>The notification's own server flag reads on while that one video continues
 *       ({@link #notificationAllowed}), until the handler's return to Facebook has hidden it.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Off, paused, before the settings are ready, for any handler of Facebook's own, or when anything
 * here throws, Facebook decides as it would unpatched, and without its flags that's no background
 * sound. A hook that can't read the player gives a no.
